# Multithreaded-Getfile-Server
Project Objective: Designing a Multi-Threaded Server for Static File Serving

In this project, I will architect and implement a robust multi-threaded server. The server’s primary purpose is to serve static files based on the GetFile protocol, which closely resembles a simplified HTTP-like protocol. Here are the key components:

Server Implementation:
The server will be written in C.
It will handle concurrent requests using a multi-threaded design.
Our focus will be on efficiency, reliability, and security.
Client Load Generator:
In addition to the server, I will create a multi-threaded client.
The client’s role is to act as a load generator, simulating various request scenarios.
By stress-testing the server, we can evaluate its performance under different workloads.
Sound and Scalable Design:
Both the server and client will adhere to sound software engineering principles.
Scalability will be a key consideration, ensuring that the system can handle increased load gracefully.
